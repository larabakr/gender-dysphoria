          Etiologically speaking, a trans person is a human whose gonadal and
          cerebral sexual differentiations are incongruent (or put simply, in
          opposite directions, mismatch) due to underlying genetic, endocrine,
          epigenetic (through gene expression and epigentic regulation where
          some genes are deactivated while others are activated, enzyme
          function, regulation and interaction with stressors), pre natal brain
          development, fetal exposure factors and neurological factors during
          specific gestational windows (along with 10 other factors mentioned
          later on, it's a biological mosaic with a complex interplay of said
          elements). [For example: A different sexual differentiation of the
          brain as a result of changes in the DNA sequence of the estrogen
          receptors ERs and androgen receptor AR genes.], along with other
          factors,
          <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10983252/" target="_blank"
            >it can even be hereditary</a

          (Bocklandt, S., et al. 2012; Garcia-Couto, E., et al. 2017; Menni, S.,
          et al. 2018; Savic, I., et al. 2019; Diamond, L. M., et al. 2016).
          <br /><br />
          Which causes Gender dysphoria: the phenotypic expression of multiple
          underlying factors which results in permanent structural changes to
          the affected person’s neural architecture; This is not a disorder of
          emotion, behavior or thought, therefore, not a mental illness, it's
          rather a neurobiological mismatch. it leads to severe distress in the
          same way phantom pain isn’t a mental disorder but has a psychological
          manifestation or aspect, but are not purely psychological disorders.
          [There is universal consensus that 'transness' itself isn't a disorder
          but it's the depressive symptoms as a result of the incongruence,
          rather than from an intrinsic disorder] but a natural variation of
          human biology. It is a neurobiological mosaic.

          Gender dysphoria is a complex condition that is often difficult to
          understand for those who do not experience it. Gender dysphoria
          mirrors the experience of phantom limb pain (a condition where the
          brain retains the representation of a missing limb), where the brain
          senses a mismatch between the body and the brain (the brain
          intrinsically senses that the body should have certain features,
          dysphoria is a deeply distressing condition rooted in the brain's
          representation of the body ), which causes intense distress and pain
          that impacts every aspect of life. The two conditions share some
          underlying neural mechanisms as well, in the somatosensory cortex,
          this distress is linked to brain regions responsible for
          self-perception, body-image and body schema. Such as the insula, SLF,
          IPL and other parietal regions for example. They also share similar
          treatment methods, such as mirror therapy which creates the illusion
          that the missing limb is present, and virtual reality therapy where
          the person can interact with their missing limb in a virtual
          environment created using a computer. Transitioning helps to align the
          brain and the body similarly. It's more about an intense misalignment
          (hence why phantom pain is a perfect analogy) rather than a mere
          preference or desire.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Put simply, genetics and hormones build the map. The map is the body
          schema encoded in specific brain networks (the insula, premotor
          cortex, and temporoparietal junction). Dysphoria is when that map
          doesn't match the terrain. And that, is the etiology in a nutshell.
          When this happens, they get neuropsychological pain due to mismatched
          information (the brain's body schema conflicts with the sensory and
          perceptual input of the body) which leads to distress through
          alienation, depersonalization and dissocation thereby activating
          emotional and stress-related networks (such as the HPA axis) which
          involve sensorimotor incongruence (two conflicting realities both
          stemming from prenatally established biology) and somatic distress,
          the chronic stress resulting from this can lead to stress-induced
          maladaptive neuroplastic changes (gray matter reductions in the
          hippocampus) that reinforce gender dysphoria by altering brain
          structure and it often develops into central sensitization and
          hyperalgesia then psychosomatic pain with the addition of headaches,
          stomach problems, and muscle tension due to the linkage of the brain's
          distress with physical sensation. Which is a self-reinforcing cycle
          through hebbian plasticity. Not just emotional discomfort. This
          chronic stress also causes elevated cortisol and amygdala
          hyperactivity/hippocampal shrinkage if left untreated. It is later
          exacerbated by pubertal hormones via androgen/estrogen-driven
          secondary sex characteristics. And this is not because being trans is
          pathological, but because the brain receives conflicting sensory and
          perceptual input. The body feels “wrong” or alien. Not due to a
          pathology of identity or confusion, but because of a biological
          incongruence between the body and brain (prenatal biology → neural
          wiring → sensorimotor incongruence → pubertal exacerbation → stress →
          neuroplasticity → somatic symptoms).

          To clarify on how the brain intrinsically senses that it should have
          certain characteristics or when we metaphorically refer to a
          "body-map" (which is an actual neuroscience topic called a body
          schema): "Findings suggest that the neuroanatomical signature of
          transgenderism is related to brain areas processing the perception of
          self and body ownership" from

          All of the genetic, postmortem and in-vivo scanning observations
          support the neurobiological theory about the origin of gender
          dysphoria. it is the sizes of brain structures (including ones that
          are not plastic), the neuron numbers, the molecular composition,
          functions, and connectivity of brain structures that determine our
          gender identity. It is a lifelong, congenital, condition that is not
          caused by any psychological or social factors. (Bao & Swaab, 2011;

          The medical explanation for being transgender is primarily rooted in
          biological and neurological differences that develop during early
          life, particularly in the womb. It is not caused by social or
          environmental influences. While biological factors play a primary
          role, societal and environmental influences, such as exposure to rigid
          gender norms or supportive versus hostile environments, can shape how
          someone understands and expresses their gender identity. Meaning it
          affects gender expression and how one would cope with dysphoria. The
          social enviornment affects behaviors, preferences and desires but it
          doesn't alter the innate sense of self.

          41% of trans people attempt suicide by age 30 (Dhejne et al. 2014),
          this is an alarming statistic that illustrates the immense challenges

          with hormone therapy, and can be reduced to less than 5% with the
          support of family and friends (Denis R. Lafontaine, A. Ashley Cross,
          Michael J. W. Schmidt, et al. 2015). [Having a supportive family
          reduced suicide rates by 57% and access to legal documentation
          reflecting ones gender reduces suicide rate by 44%, Parental support
          is associated with a 93% reduction in suicide attempts (Bauer, et al.
          2015; PULSE 2012). The ability to transition, to use their actual
          name, social support all drastically reduce suicide attempts and
          thoughts (Rusell 2018; Moody & Smith 2013; Bauer 2015). Supporting
          trans people is an ethical imperative. Denying care or support is not
          a neutral act; it actively contributes to harm. <br /><br />
          Being attacked on the basis of gender, restriction of teens to access
          bathrooms of their gender, discrimination, homelessness and violence
          all increase suicidality (Herman, et al. 2019; Barboza, et al. 2016).
          After controlling for minority stress (discrimination) and access to
          healthcare (a proxy for poverty, and a measure of the ability to
          transition), trans people have a mental health quality of life similar
          to that of the general population (Ainsworth & Spiegel 2010; Nobili,
          et al. 2018). <br /><br />
          Scientists have tried to treat gender dysphoria by affirming the sex
          assigned at birth to no avail (Gelder & Marks, 1969; Greenson, 1964;
          Cohen-Kettenis & Kuiper, 1984; Pauly, 1965) as it doesn’t address the
          underlying cause: the incongruence mentioned above. Such treatment is
          no longer considered ethical and you cannot make trans people
          cisgender. They‘ve even tried electroconvulsive therapy &
          psychosurgery and failed at treating gender dysphoria (Diamond & Joel,
          2010; Jorgensen & Drescher, 2012). Other forms of therapy is involved
          in the process of transitioning but none of them are intended to make
          trans people accept their AGAB (assigned gender at birth). Decades of
          research confirm that transition is the only effective treatment (APA,
          2021; WPATH SOC8). <br /><br /><img

          Gender dysphoria worsens over time if not treated (Dhejne, C., Van
          Vlerken, R. H., Heylens, M., & Arcelus, J. 2016; Nobili, A., et al.
          2018; Majid, M., et al. 2019), so neuroplasticity cannot get rid of
          gender dysphoria as it cannot fundamentally alter deeply embedded
          structures related to sex differentiation, it‘s limited by the genetic
          makeup of the person and a couple dozen other factors, early
          development is irrevesible, brain structures and processes established
          during critical development periods (in utero) are deeply embedded
          (fixed). Neuroplasticity allows the brain to adapt and rewire in
          response to experiences, learning, or damage, it has its limitations.
          Not all areas of the brain exhibit the same degree of plasticity. In
          this instance, the structures and processes involved in sex
          differentiation are set during critical developmental periods, in
          utero rather post natally. These changes are not easily modified later
          by neuroplasticity. Certain aspects of brain development are
          relatively permanent once formed —such as differences in white matter
          pathways or gray matter volumes—. Just as neuroplasticity doesn't
          "cure" phantom pain, as it involves a deeper, more ingrained
          neurological basis that adaptation alone can't modify. This is also
          why socialization doesn't cause or fix it, socialization affects the
          brain through neuroplasticity, the above applies. Speaking of

          There is no evidence that one's postnatal social environment plays a
          crucial role in the development of gender identity or sexual
          orientation. Rather, the environment affects the gender expression and
          not the identity. The findings suggest that lifetime and childhood
          exposure to gender identity conversion efforts are associated with
          adverse mental health outcomes (Turban et al., 2020), you cannot make
          trans people cis (Turban & Ehrensaft 2018; Heiden-Rootes K, et al.
          2021; Turban, et al. 2019), it‘s always been unsuccessful and harmful.
          The environment affects gender expression and not identity.

            >Being trans is not a phase for children, their gender identity is
            very stable</a
          >, and it certainly has nothing to do with sexual orientation
          (Kaltiala-Heino, et al. 2018; Thompson, et al. 2022; NHS 2020; Crocq
          2021). Prenatal and pubertal sex hormones seem to permanently affect
          human behaviour and, in addition, heritability studies have
          demonstrated a role of genetic components. (Ristori, et al. 2020).
          <br />
          <br />
          Sexual orientation has nothing to do with the etiology of gender
          dysphoria (Stefanie Smith, et al. 2015; De Vries et al. 2015; Olson et
          al. 2016; Reisner et al. 2017; Durwood et al. 2020; Wallien &
          Cohen-Kettenis 2010; Steensma et al. 2008). They have different
          etiology, mechanism and dimensions. different neural pathways,
          distinct biological processes that operate independently. Different
          genetic components, different prenatal hormone mechanism affecting
          different regions at different timeframes. Different neurobiology and
          neurochemistry. Different developmental pathways. Both are innate and
          immutable. Not influenced by social environment or psychology in
          etiology. Neither does psychology or the environment, they only affect
          the experience of gender dysphoria, for better or for worse. This is
          the way their brain is wired. However, gender expression can be as
          it's influenced by society and culture. These 3 are distinct and
          independent dimensions of identity, they don't have to be in harmony
          and this is the beauty of natural biological variety. It's congenital,
          they're just born that way.

          Gender dysphoria is fundamentally distinct from Body dysmorphia.
          Gender dysphoria is a biological condition rooted in atypical cerebral
          sex differentiation (the brain's development does not align with the
          body's misassigned sex) because of prenatal endocrine, genetic and
          epigenetic, neurodevelopmental factors, this is not simply a matter of
          perception but rooted in measurable neuroanatomical and neurochemical
          differences. While body dysmorphia dysmorphia is excessive focus and
          overinflated "flaw" perception of the body (involves hyperactivity in
          the regions implicated in obsessive-compulsive behaviors and distorted
          self-image processing ). The distress in body dysmorphia stems from
          distorted perceptions or imagined flaws, whereas the distress in
          gender dysphoria stems from a genuine biological incongruence. This is
          why gender affirming care cannot be compared to liposuction or
          cosmetic plastic surgery (typically elective). Instead, they are
          medically-necessary reconstructive procedures. <br /><br />
          Gender identity is innate and biologically based → Affirming care is
          medically necessary.
          <br /><br />
          TLDR; Gender dysphoria = Biological mismatch (brain/body sex
          differentiation). Body dysmorphia = Perceptual distortion (no
          underlying mismatch). <br /><br />

          Neurobiological research suggests that both gender dysphoria and
          sexual orientation are influenced by brain structures and functions.
          But it doesn't mean that they have the same differences, studies have
          identified distinct patterns in regions such as the hypothalamus and
          amygdala. The two phenomena are, however, fundamentally & biologically
          unalike, homosexual orientation was found to be associated with less
          pronounced cerebral sex dimorphism. Gender dysphoria also involves
          cerebral networks mediating self–body perception. Structural and
          functional differences of hypothalamic nuclei and other brain areas
          differ in relation to sexual identity and sexual orientation,
          indicating that these traits develop independently. This may be a
          result of differing hormone sensitivities and/or separate critical
          periods, although this remains to be explored. Subtle variations in
          these networks can have significant implications, highlighting the
          importance of considering the broader context of brain function rather
          than focusing solely on isolated regions. Sexual orientation is
          biologically conferred in the first trimester of pregnancy. Gender
          identity is biologically conferred during the middle trimester of
          pregnancy. They follow different developmental paths during gestation
          with their own unique neural correlates, these traits emerge through
          distinct biological processes & are biologically conferred at
          different stages.

          <b>However</b>, multiple layers of evidence confirm that sexual
          orientation and gender identity are as biological, innate and
          immutable as the other traits conferred during that critical time in
          gestation. (

          From neuroanatomist Simon Levay in the April 2011 issue of Frontiers
          of Neuroendocrinology, “The book on social influences [on sexual
          orientation and gender identity] is not closed, so much as it is
          blank”. From neuroscientist D. F. Swaab in Functional Neurology:
          <b
            >“There is no proof that social environment after birth has an
            effect on gender identity or sexual orientation”</b
          >. The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from a
          psychopathological designation in 1973. In the 2013 DSM-5, the
          American Psychiatric Association affirmed that “gender nonconformity
          is not in itself a mental disorder, but a discontent with the assigned
          gender and the apparent gender of their bodies”. Since then, sexual
          orientation and gender identity have gradually become protected as
          statuses that should not endure discrimination or lack of
          accommodation by state and federal laws. Social environments interact
          with neurobiological foundations, but they do not "determine"
          identity, the role of prenatal hormones and neurodevelopmental
          processes in determining gender identity is distinct from general
          personality traits and broader social behaviors which may be more
          influenced by social factors. The biological processes discussed in
          medical literature involve hormonal surges, genetics, and
          neurodevelopmental mechanisms that occur long before socialization can
          play a role.

          The absence of strictly "male" or "female" brains doesn't negate
          gender dysphoria as a neurobiological condition. And that is not what
          is being said here, brain sexual differentiation is mosiac. But not in
          a way it affects us cognitively or affecting how analytical/emotional
          we think nor does it determine decision-making functions, that is
          patriarchal and ascientific (has been debunked by contemporary
          neuroscience), it's important to differentiate what's being talked
          about in this piece; Instead, it highlights the complexity of gender
          and the brain, <b>where patterns, not absolutes</b>, shape our
          understanding of gender identity and its strong biological
          underpinnings. it emphasizes that gender identity is more complex than
          binary biological categories. As it is a spectrum, like biological sex
          is. This predetermined and stored sense of self is rooted in the
          brain's structure and function, shaped by a complex interplay of
          genetics, prenatal hormones, and neurodevelopmental factors. This DOES
          NOT confirm or verify that social norms as rigid natural sets of
          behaviors. In fact, brain sex differences have nothing to do with that
          at all. Core identity is biological and emerges from brain development
          and is likely established before birth due to hormonal, genetic, and
          neurological factors. <br /><br />It reveals the complexity of brain
          development, where the brain's structure and function are influenced
          by multiple factors, including genetics, hormones, and womb
          environment. Rather than being rigidly divided into "male" and
          "female," brains exist on a spectrum, with overlapping characteristics
          that do not fit neatly into binary categories. Despite the absence of
          rigidly male or female brains, gender dysphoria has strong
          neurobiological and chemical foundations. Sex differences in the brain
          are well-documented, a lot of them are present at birth.. (see
          <a href="#refer">references</a>), particularly in regions that
          regulate emotion, cognition, and behavior. Additionally, neurochemical
          differences in serotonin, dopamine, and other neurotransmitter systems
          have been observed in individuals with gender dysphoria, which could
          contribute to the distress they experience when their gender identity
          does not align with their assigned sex.

          Autism and gender dysphoria; It's complicated. There's this idea that
          autism is overrepresented among people with gender dysphoria and vice
          versa. The backstory of this is from studies where they gave people
          with gender dysphoria autism screening instruments, called the social
          responsiveness scale or the autism quotient, that do not establish a
          diagnosis. And there is other research that shows if you have other
          anxiety or depression, as many as 80% of kids who have anxiety or
          depression but don't have autism will score in the clinical range on
          these scales. Those scales are just not very specific, it didn't
          really establish that all of those kids had autism because medical
          professionals knew that they had a high rate of anxiety and depression
          so it wasn't surprising that a lot of them were scoring positive.
          There was also the dutch study where they looked at the rate of them
          screening positive for prepubertal kids and it was pretty much the
          same as the general population, but when they looked at it in the
          teens that's when all of a sudden they were more kids with autism but
          you don't develop autism in your teens. But you develop anxiety and
          depression in your teens because that's usually when these kids for
          the first time are experiencing a lot of bullying and stigma etc. The
          issue with a lot of those studies was the instrument and methodology.
          The other side of studies looked at kids with autism and they used
          CBCL (Child Behavior Checklist) that stated "Do you feel like you're
          the other gender? Zero, never, one, sometimes, or two, often." and
          they combined the ones and twos and called that gender dysphoria, but
          people with autism have slightly more rigid thinking and so for
          instance there are adolescent patients with autism who had a
          stereotypical interest like an autistic boy who likes knitting, he'd
          be like "yeah, sometimes I feel like a girl". But that's not a kid
          with gender dysphoria. This is why the scientific community was not
          buying them. Then that devolved into popular press headlines being
          like "these trans people just have autism" and that autism gives you
          these repetitive, restrictive interests and then they're just obsessed
          with gender and that's what makes them trans. However, comprehensive
          reviews of the literature have found no solid evidence to support this
          theory. While both autism and gender dysphoria each affect around 1%
          of the population, and some people may have both, they aren't causally
          linked, this does not imply causation. So there are gonna be kids who
          have both. And it is a unique thing because their experience of the
          world, and gender, and social norms, and their rigid thinkingdoes
          require a special approach for supporting them in their gender. And so
          the latest WPATH guidelines actually recommend that anyone working
          with trans youth does have training and experience with autism to be
          able to support those types of kids. [

          On nature versus nurture; David Reimer was a boy who suffered a
          botched circumcision when he was six months old which resulted in the
          loss of his penis. In the early 1960s, John Money, a sexologist &
          psychologist, convinced his parents to raise him as a girl, believing
          that gender identity could be assigned and that environmental factors
          were more influential than biological ones. His parents were convinced
          and David underwent surgery to appear female and was named Brenda.
          Money and his team were convinced that with 'proper' socialization,
          'Brenda' would accept her new identity. However, despite the
          intervention, David experienced significant distress as he grew up,
          feeling a misalignment between his gender identity and the gender he
          was forced to be —essentially the opposite of being trans. He ended up
          transitioning back to living as a male in his teenage years.
          Throughout his childhood, Reimer was not informed about his male
          biology. He experienced significant distress due to this. In his early
          twenties he attempted suicide twice and at the age of thirty-eight,
          Reimer committed suicide by firearm. David's situation underscores
          that gender dysphoria is not a product of social upbringing but rather
          an innate biological phenomenon. You cannot make trans people cis and
          vice versa. This teaches us that conversion therapy cannot work; You
          cannot force someone to be either cis or trans.

          The story of David illustrates that informed consent (for adults) is a
          more humane and effective approach to addressing gender dysphoria than
          medical gatekeeping, If someone takes HRT and feels that it aligns
          their physical appearance with their gender identity (i.e. the
          incongruence between the brain and the body is lessened; As
          dysphoria/euphoria are two sides of the same coin), then this would be
          the strongest evidence of gender dysphoria. It's a biological
          condition but it isn't necessarily visible with the naked eye, it
          manifests psychologically. That's why gender dysphoria is in the
          DSM-V-TR. Not because it's a mental disorder, but because we can only
          reliably screen and diagnose it based on its psychological symptoms
          Psychological suffering is the measurable symptom, basically. There's
          no universal experience of gender dysphoria, variability is
          undeniable. <br /><br />
          This is most likely because the biological variables that contribute
          to gender dysphoria in etiology are, well, variables. This is the
          evidence aligned answer. For example, neutoanatomical variability,
          genetic factors, pre-natal hormonal influences and their timing (which
          is critical), neurochemical differences, ERα methylation, AR
          Sensitivity Polymorphisms, neurotransmitter response to sex hormones,
          somatosensory cortex organization, estrobolome variability, immune
          system microglial priming with neuroinflammation, and so much more. It
          is a convergence of dozens of biological processes that differ per
          individual. Biological variability underlies the diversity of trans
          experiences. And this is why informed consent is a better way to
          approach it and why rigid diagnoses fail. No test is better than lived
          experience. not until we can literally look into the brain
          anatomically and physiologically in a way that is detailed enough to
          be used diagnostically. And our instruments and understanding of the
          brain are simply not advanced enough for that. We barely know how the
          brain works. <br /><br />
          The fact that someone would immediately detransition if they were not
          truly transgender is illustrated by David Reimer's case. Because when
          there is no biological incongruence between the sex differentiation
          and that of the gonads and therefore the body, taking HRT would induce
          such incongruence, which prompts them to stop. And adults are sentient
          enough to recognize that, and when they do, which they often do, they
          simply stop. Best case study is David Reimer, we need to learn from
          his story. The lesson learned is not that trans healthcare is bogus
          mutilation, it's that gender dysphoria is not a choice. Brains aren't
          blank slates. David's brain expected a male body; forcing feminization
          induced dysphoria. While if it works, their brain is likely responding
          to the "correct" hormone, this proving an underlying incongruence.
          Remember, look at the data. 1% detransition rate, and the overwhelming
          majority of detransitioners do so because of outside factors.
          <br /><br />
          HRT's early effects are reversible (breast growth and infertility are
          the major irreversible changes, and they takes months, more than
          enough for adults to figure out if this is right for them or not). The
          ICD-11 removed "gender identity disorder" for this reason, it's about
          incongruence, not a faulty self-perception. A 3-month buffer is enough
          time to let HRT do its thing and it's still way before the
          irreversible chanegs can take place, medical professionals monitor
          outcomes and determine if patients should continue this line of
          treatment on top of considering their opinion. If HRT improves
          someone's life after 3-6 months, that's the best diagnostic tool. HRT
          persistence = diagnostic. Medical gatekeeping often involves lengthy
          assessments, therapy requirements, and external validations of one's
          gender identity. This process can be stigmatizing and may delay access
          to necessary care for those experiencing dysphoria. It also doesn't
          provide better proof of gender dysphoria. It just delays urgent care
          and worsens mental health in a very critical and vulnerable stage for
          transgender minors and adults. <br /><br />
          Many medications with far more dangerous risks (SSRIs, ADHD
          stimulants, even chemotherapy) are handed out more easily than
          gender-affirming care. The goal of medicine is harm reduction and
          quality of life. Informed consent respects that.

          Research indicates that, although the levels of psychopathology and
          psychiatric disorders in trans people attending services at the time
          of assessment are higher than in the cis population, they do improve
          following gender-confirming medical intervention, in many cases
          reaching normative values. The main Axis I psychiatric disorders were
          found to be depression and anxiety disorder. Other major psychiatric
          disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, were rare and
          were no more prevalent than in the general population. (<a

        The denial of gender-affirming care doesn't just delay treatment—it
        directly puts lives at risk. When trans people are denied the ability to
        transition, the resulting hopelessness, compounded by social rejection
        and discrimination, often leads to suicidal desperation. Access to care
        isn't just about improving quality of life; it's about survival.

          cells with aggressive cisgender male cellmates as both a reward and a
          means of placation for said cellmates, so as to maintain social
          control and to, as one inmate described it, "keep the violence rate
          down." Trans women used in this manner are often raped daily. This
          process has been described as so common that it is effectively "a
          central part of a trans woman's sentence".<br /><br />

          Transgender populations experience high levels of discrimination in
          various aspects such as employment (National Center for Transgender
          Equality [NCTE], 2009) as well as increased instances of physical
          violence (Stotzer et al., 2014). Access to legal recognition for one's
          gender identity has been shown to improve mental health outcomes among
          transgender people (Kattari et al., 2020). Social acceptance and
          family support play important roles in reducing psychological distress
          among transgender people (Ryan et al., 2010; Sutter & Perrin 2016).
          Transgender people experience high levels of unemployment and poverty
          compared to the general population (James et al., 2016). Transgender
          students may face unique challenges in educational settings such as
          bullying or lack of accommodations for their gender identity (Greytak
          et al., 2009).

          Research shows that trans women who receive hormone therapy do not
          necessarily hold advantages over cisgender female competitors (Hilton
          & Lundberg, 2021). trans women do not have an unfair athletic
          advantage over their cisgender peers (<a

          To summarize the sports debate A trans woman on estrogen will have
          female-typical muscle strength within a year, even if she was athletic
          pre-transition. After 2+ years of HRT, trans women’s muscle strength,
          VO₂ max, and bone density fall within cis female ranges.

          Sex is not a binary (Ainsworth 2015), there are a number of factors
          that contribute to a person's sex, including their chromosomes,
          hormones, genitals, gene expression patterns, and secondary sex
          characteristics, almost all of them overlap, even secondary sex
          differences like in bones. ~1.7% of people‘s sex chromosome pattern
          doesn’t fit the XX/XY categories. (<a

          Gamete production, chromosomes, genitals and hormones are all not
          binary: some people may have both testicles and ovaries or they might
          not have genitals (Müllerian aplasia (MRKH)/penile agenesis), some
          people have XXY chromosomes, etc. (Montañez, 2017). Biological
          essentialist views are fundamentally incompatible with scientific
          understandings of human biology (American Psychological Association,
          2006; Blackless et al., 2000; Fausto-Sterling, 2000). Secondary sex
          characteristics are also not binary, there is a wide range of normal
          variation in these characteristics. Therefore, these cases cannot be
          brushed off as being mutations as they are the results of biological
          variation (biological sex has no set definition in addition to that).

          There are two kinds of chromossomes: sex chromosomes and autosomal
          chromosomes (i.e., not sex chromosomes.). Sex chromosomes serve to
          define if you're going to develop a testosterone producing gonad
          (testicles), or a estrogen producing gonad (ovaries) (as well as
          having the genes for the gonads to work properly). However, 99% of the
          sexed characteristics are stored in the autosomal chromosomes. The
          female and male genes are in the autosomal chromosomes, males also
          have female genes, and females also have male genes, they are just
          expressed differently. Testosterone and estrogen is what defines what
          genes in the autosomal chromossomes will be expressed, hence making
          someone biologically become male or female. Male genes being expressed
          in the uterus will result in the formation of a male reproductive
          system, and female genes will result in the formation of a female
          reproductive system. Someone with a XY genotype with a defective SRY
          gene (that is the one trigger that makes you develop testicles), even
          if they have all the other normal genes, will develop as a woman, and
          will even be able to give birth using their womb (<a
            href="https://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/ea/0013/ea0013p253"
            target="_blank"
            >https://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/ea/0013/ea0013p253</a
          >). This happens because, without testicles and therefore without
          testosterone, the female genes will be expressed and the person will
          be a female. Someone with a male reproductive system, for example,
          will develop female secondary sexual characteristics if they have
          their male puberty blocked and is supplemented female hormones. Though
          they will still have a male reproductive system, they will have a
          female gene expression and therefore will develop as a normal female
          would. Having XY sex chromosomes does not make you "genetically male"
          and having XX chromosomes does not make you "genetically female", it's
          your gene expression, and therefore hormonal profile, that does so,
          because most of the genes that make a man or a woman are located in
          the autosomal chromosomes.

          Hormone replacement changes gene expression, making cells/tissue act

          Speaking of bones.. Bones don‘t really fit in a binary of the two
          genders. Skeletal studies clearly show how society‘s assumptions about
          sex can lead to errors, acknowledging that things are not really as
          binary as they may seem can help to resolve those errors. <br /><br />
          Scientists Fred P. Thieme and William J. Schull of the University of
          Michigan wrote about sexing a skeleton in 1957: “Sex, unlike most
          phenotypic features in which man varies, is not continuously variable
          but is expressed in a clear bimodal distribution.” <br /><br />
          In 1972, Kenneth Weiss, a professor of anthropology & genetics,
          noticed that there were about %12 more male skeletons than females
          reported at archaeological sites* the reason for the bias, Weiss
          concluded, was an “irresistible temptation in many cases to call
          doubtful specimens male.” For example, a tall woman with a narrow hip
          might be mistakenly cataloged as a man. <br /><br />
          After he published his paper, practices improved. 21 years later more
          recent datasets show that the bias declined: The ratio of male to
          female skeletons had balanced out. <br /><br />

          *: (Kenneth M. Weiss 1972) In part that might be because of better,
          more accurate ways of sexing skeletons. But it is also noted that
          there were more individuals categorized as “indeterminate” after 1972
          and basically none prior.
          <br /><br />
          This is acceptance of the overlap between the sexes. It doesn't really
          mean that the skeletons classified this way are neither male nor
          female, but it means that there is no clear or easy way to tell the
          difference.

          Basically, “male” and “female” are two distributions with significant
          overlap.

          So what's a woman? An adult human female. What is female? A biological
          classification characterized by a combination of sex characteristics,
          including chromosomes (typically XX), gonads (ovaries), gametes
          (production of ova or sperm), hormones (higher levels of estrogen),
          and secondary sexual characteristics. Sex is composed of both
          genotypes and phenotypes. All of these factors overlap with no
          singular determining factor that can account for every individual's
          biological profile. <br /><br />
          A woman is a woman regardless of her features, femininity, and
          functions, regardless of her weight, race, colour, height, conformity
          to conventional beauty standards, ability, disability, or sexuality.

          Children often develop an understanding of their gender identity
          around ages 3-5 years old (Olson et al., 2015; Gülgöz, et al. 2019;
          Signorella et al. 1993; Ruble, at al. 2007; AAP 2015; Bussey & Bandura

            target="_blank"
            >Researchers</a
          >
          found that nearly all Trans men and women became fully aware of their
          gender dysphoria by age 7. <br /><br />
          Transgender children show strong coherence and consistency in their
          gender identity with very stabe gender development that persists
          regardless of socialization and gender-norms. And their gender
          development does not appear to show lingering impact of early
          sex-assignment or sex-specific socialization (10-y-old transgender
          girl who was labeled a boy at birth and raised for 9 y as a boy and
          one who was labeled and raised as a boy for 5 years and a cisgender
          girl did NOT differ in how firm their identities are, for example).
          This proves that neither sex assignment at birth nor direct or
          indirect sex-specific socialization and expectations (e.g., rewarding
          masculine things and punishing feminine ones for assigned males) in
          alignment with early assignment necessarily define how a child later
          identifies or expresses their gender. Evidence shows that their gender
          identity does not appear to be shaped by early sex assignment or by
          years of sex-specific socialization. This shows that transgender kids
          are NOT confused, nor are they delusional or "too young to know",
          their sense of self is just as stable and strong as that of their
          cisgender peers.

          Puberty blockers are considered safe and reversible treatments for

          have been in use for 30+ years of pediatric use (mainly to treat
          precocious puberty), and have no documented cases of permanent harm.
          They don't cause infertility — they're reversible. And puberty resumes
          after stopping. This is why calling them 'puberty blockers' is
          medically astute, they simply delay puberty with no permanent harm and
          puberty remains resumable. With a side effect profile milder than most
          allergy medications and, an extremely high satisfaction rate. Sounds
          perfect to me. <br /><br />
          And no, they do not mess with bone density, fertility, neurocognitive
          ability or BMI and they improve mental health. <br /><br />
          GnRH is a naturally occurring hormone in humans responsible for the
          release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone
          (LH) from the pituitary gland. Through this mechanism, the body
          produces its gonadal estrogen and testosterone. GnRH agonists bind to
          the GnRH receptor and activate it, causing it to be continuously
          stimulated. This causes an initial increase of LH and FSH, then over
          the course of several weeks, causes the pituitary gland to become
          desensitised, pausing the natural sex hormone production for the
          duration the medication is taken. When the medication is stopped, its
          effect is reversed, with normal sex hormone production resuming about
          a week after the medication clears the body

          on Gender-affirming Care for Adolescent Gender Dysphoria, published by
          Yale Law School’s The Integrity Project has been led by Yale school of
          medicine, OHSU school of medicine, USC school of medicine, UCSF school
          of medicine, Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Australia,
          Drexel University Department of Epidemiology, Whitman-Walker Institute
          and Yale school of law. MDs and PhDs from all over North America and
          Australia. Medical organizations in countries like Australia, Canada,
          and Germany have also stated that the cass findings do not align with
          evidence-based guidelines.
          <br /><br />
          The Cass Review dismissed high-quality longitudinal studies (like de
          Vries et al.) as "weak" without justification, while relying on
          low-quality detransitioner narratives. They excluded positive outcomes
          from clinics like Amsterdam’s Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria,
          which has decades of follow-up data. The University of York’s evidence
          assessment (commissioned by Cass) arbitrarily excluded studies that
          showed mental health benefits of puberty blockers. Cass speculated
          about "social influence" driving referrals but cited no robust data to
          support this claim. Even though the Journal of Pediatrics (2021) and
          Turban et al. (2023) found no evidence of social contagion. Thereby
          artificially creating an evidence gap so they can provide a
          justification for restrictions, not an impartial evaluation. Because
          it was commissioned by NHS england amid rising political pressure to
          curb youth transitions. Creating a moral panic by amplifying extremely
          rare detransitioner stories, spreading myths such as kids are being
          rushed in transitioning.
          <br /><br />

            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X23005608"
            >cohort study</a
          >
          of nearly 500 trans youth. It was shown that having puberty blocked
          was associated with significantly lower T-scores on the Youth Self
          Report for internalizing problems, anxiety problems, depressive
          problems, stress problems, and total problems. The blocker population
          was also significantly less likely to report any suicidal thoughts.
          <br /><br />1 in 5 high schoolers are prescribed Schedule II controled
          stimulants. This is crazy. But people are freaking out over, what,
          2000 high schoolers delaying their puberty as part of a comprehensive
          treatment plan for a serious medical condition? 2000 out of 42.9
          million adolescents in the U.S. is 0.005%, compare that to 20% of them
          being on Schedule II stimulants that literally cause psychosis. Why do
          GnRH agonists occupy so much media space while this goes unnoticed?
          <br /><br />
          There is an unwarranted distrust of medical institutions And not
          enough distrust of health insurance companies. If anything, the fact
          that health insurance tries it's very best to not cover any
          gender-affirming treatment even in states like california should tell
          you everything you need to know about this 'debate'. (you have to SUE
          your insurance and have a california judge FORCE them to pay for your
          medically-necessary reconstructive surgeries in the future, this is
          how it works. Proof this isn't a "profit-driven" practice). I hate
          even referring to it as a 'debate', a debate between who? Doctors and
          people who can barely speak their mother language, it's insane. 130
          million American adults have low literacy skills. Only 37.7% of
          Americans have a bachelor's degree, yet the 60% of the population that
          barely has a high school diploma or GED gets to vote on who gets
          access to this critical treatment.
          <br /><br />Trans kids who are treated for their gender dysphoria have
          depression/anxiety levels similar to those of cisgender kids (de
          Vries, et al. 2014; Durwood, et al. 2017).

          Kids are not rushed into transitioning. Most of the process consists
          of comprehensive psychiatric sessions, evaluations, consults with
          doctors, psychiatrist, pediatricians, endocrinologists, etc. And
          careful monitoring, long waitlists (4+ years in some countries),
          parental approval, therapist letters and multiple assessments. Let's
          not forget the barriers to insurance coverage.
          <br /><br />
          These guardrails are in place to ensure that those who do transition
          are doing the right thing for them. Giving them time to explore their
          identities without the added pressure of physical changes that could
          be in conflict with their innate identity, not all of them end up
          having dysphoria and thus not transitioning, some children are simply
          experimenting with gender expression which is fine, its a normal path
          of development. Not everyone who thinks they're trans has to be
          actually trans. Expression may not always align identity. With no
          puberty blockers until tanner II and you may start
          estrogen/teststerone around 12.5 years old on a case by case basis to
          protect bone density. <br /><br />
          Minors make other high-stakes decisions: chemotherapy, abortions,
          organ transplantation, HIV treatment, IUDs, End-of-Life, DNR orders,
          and more. Teens can legally consent or refuse chemotherapy (which
          actually has a risk of infertility and organ damage unlike puberty
          blockers) or radiation for life-threatening illnesses in many
          jurisdictions. In many states and countries, minors can access
          abortion services without parental consent under mature minor
          doctrines. Teens can also consent to organ transplantation, procedures
          with lifelong medication, rejection risks, and major physical burdens.
          Teens can consent to undergoing HIV treatments that are several orders
          of magnitude more dangerous than puberty blockers, in fact, every
          example listed is significantly more dangerous/risky than puberty
          blockers.
          <br /><br />
          And you cannot start HRT before 16 years old, and you cannot have any
          form of surgery until you‘re 18 (WPATH; endocrine society; ICD). Being
          trans is not a trend, it is not a social contigation and is not
          affected by societal pressure (or else for example, the oppression of
          trans women in the middle east would 'un-trans' them) (Turban 2022 and
          <a
            href="https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(23)00070-8/abstract"

            >2023</a
          >; Ashley 2020; Restar 2020; Bauer, et al. 2021). While HRT surely has
          potential risks (Chan swe, et al. 2022) (like any other medicine),
          most trans individuals who undergo hormone therapy do not experience
          severe complications. (Asscheman et al., 2014 and 2011). <br /><br />
          Because their bodies move to a female endocrine environment, so as
          long as the‘re on appropriate estrogen levels, the health risks are
          minimal like cis female risks. Let‘s not forget that cisgender women
          are the majority of its users, and that they are bioidentical
          compounds. It's even safer than birth control pills, and does not
          increase the risk of cardiovascular disease at all.

          >. HRT doesn‘t harm your physical health and rather improves it along
          with mental health (Weinand JD 2015; Wierckx, et al. 2012; Gooren, et
          al. 2014).

          <br /><br />
          Remember that a pivotal study published in The Journal of Pediatrics
          in 2021 entirely debunked this concept of 'Social Contagion'. There's
          no evidence that being transgender is a "Social Contagion".

          The increase in visibility is what happens when stigma lowers, same as
          we have seen with left-handedness, autism diagnoses, and bisexuality.

          And again, here's what research tells us about conversion therapy:
          "Gender identity conversion efforts (GICE) are detrimental to mental
          health and should be avoided in children, adolescents, and adults."

          There's a very cautious approach to this treatment; Only 926
          adolescents with a gender-related diagnosis received puberty blockers
          from 2018 through 2022. During that time, 1,927 received hormones. The

            >study</a

          from Perth, Australia, published in JAMA Pediatrics has found that
          only <b>1%</b> of transgender youth receiving gender-affirming care at
          a clinic reidentified with their sex assigned at birth, ie 'desisted'.
          The "80% desist rate" is a myth based on flawed, outdated studies that
          have been repeatedly debunked by modern research. It was pushed by
          Zucker, whose clinic in Canada faced credible accusations of
          practicing conversion therapy and was closed in 2015 due to concerns
          about its methods. It was not even about transgender youth, it was
          about gender-nonconforming youth. Except we all know
          gender-nonconforming youth do NOT have gender dysphoria. Also,
          Zucker's research on transgender youth was performed in 1995, a time
          when youth could not legally or medically transition.

        <p>
          In a 2023 cohort study from the Netherlands, 98% of people who had
          started gender-affirming medical treatment in adolescence continued to
          use gender-affirming hormones at follow-up.

          trans kids for 5+ years; 94% still identified as trans in adolescence.

          As you can see, studies show that ~97.5% of transgender youth are
          persistent in their gender identities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Also, it is important to be aware that previous diagnostic guidelines
          regarding gender incongruence were very inaccurate, as they, for
          example, did not require a youth to identify as another gender.
          Instead, it focused on factors such as “preference for cross-sex games
          and activities” and “preference for friends of the other sex”. In
          2013, the DSM-V was published and in it, many corrections were made on
          how gender dysphoric youth are diagnosed. The most important
          correction was the requirement that a transgender youth demonstrate an
          insistent, persistent, and consistent desire or identification as the
          gender that the patient believes they are. The individual factors were
          also changed and adjusted. These diagnostic criteria were much more
          stringent, and are the diagnostic criteria used today.

          normally without an increased need for assisted reproductive

          regimens consists of retrospective cohort studies of insufficient
          follow-up duration. When assessing markers of cardiometabolic disease,
          the available literature is inconclusive, which may be ascribed to
          relatively short follow-up duration and small sample size. The
          importance of ongoing large-scale prospective studies/registries and

          assigned gender (Kupers, E. et al. 2011) They also have brains that
          respond to estrogen in a similar way to the way that cisgender women's

          to dismiss the fact that gender dysphoria is a neurobiological
          condition: They're misunderstanding; The study in question is arguing
          against broad sexual dimorphism in the human brain, but this doesn't
          contradict the neurobiological basis of gender dysphoria. Brain sex
          differences exist, just not as a simple Male/Female binary. The study
          critiques the idea of clear-cut male and female brain categories, but
          that's not what trans neurobiology research claims. Instead, studies
          show that trans people's brains exhibit traits that are sex-atypical
          in ways specifically linked to gender identity, particularly in areas
          related to body ownership, self-perception, and social processing.
          Dimorphism isn't the point, atypical sex differentiation is. Gender
          identity related differences in the brain do not require a strict
          male/female dimorphism but they involve developmental variations that
          affect neural connectivity. Just because male and female brains have
          more overlap than previously thought, doesn't mean there aren't
          meaningful sex-related patterns, especially in trans populations. It
          is undeniable that empirical research supports neurobiological gender
          identity, mutliple fMRI and MRI studies show that trans people have
          brain structures and activity patterns that are distinct from their
          misassigned sex at birth and more in line with their true sex. Such as
          in white matter tracts, cortical thickness, and even how the brain
          responds to pheromones or body perception tasks. These findings remain
          valid regardless of whether the overall male/female brain distinction
          is less pronounced than once assumed.

          Genetic studies on twins further support that gender dysphoria has its
          genetic component as discussed above (Diamond 2013), although the
          other twin can still be cisgender, it doesn‘t disregard the fact since
          not all twins have the same congenital conditions, gender dysphoria
          aside (since children have their own distinct genetic makeup even when

          There is a common myth floating around, that the pharmaceutical
          industry is controlling research on gender dysphoria for profit. Let's
          begin with the numbers, it's essential to put the size of the
          pharmaceutical market in perspective. The US overall pharmaceutical
          market is estimated to be worth $603.40bn (Statista), the US
          transgender (majority of the users are cisgender women) HRT market is
          estimated to be worth $200-$341 million (0.033%-0.056% of the market),
          while medications like aspirin ($1.3 billion) and insulin ($21.3
          billion) generate much more income. So what might seem like a huge
          amount of money to you is actually relatively small, with a
          significantly smaller portion of the market. This demonstrates that
          HRT for gender dysphoria is not a major profit driver in the
          pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry is highly
          regulated by government agencies such as the FDA in the United States.
          Much of the research on gender dysphoria is funded by government
          grants, nonprofit organizations (such as GIRES and WPATH), and
          academic institutions. Moreover, research into gender dysphoria is
          subject to rigorous peer review, and any potential conflicts of
          interest are carefully disclosed. International cooperation which
          involves a vast network of researchers and institutions worldwide
          contributes to a diverse and independent body of research. Finally, a
          strong consensus based on years of research and experience exists
          within the scientific and medical communities that gender dysphoria is
          a real medical condition that requires proper treatment.

          Regarding the theory of Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD): There is
          no empirical evidence to substantiate the claims put forth by this
          theory. The theory is based on assumptions, anecdotal reports and
          parent surveys recruited from explicitly anti-trans or trans-skeptical
          websites and forums, which are not robust sources of scientific data
          (Littman, 2018). Littman's study, which popularized the ROGD concept,
          has been heavily criticized for its methodological flaws and bias,
          with concerns raised about its survey design, sampling methods and
          questionable measurement tools, including a recruitment process that
          targeted only parents who were already skeptical of their child's
          gender identity. The concept of ROGD has not been consistently
          supported by subsequent research, and it remains a highly contentious
          and contested theory within the field. Numerous studies and experts
          have questioned the reliability and validity of the ROGD theory
          (Turban, Beckwith, Reisner, & Keuroghlian, 2019; D'Angelo & Kearney,
          2019; Restar 2019; Ashley 2020). These critiques highlight that the
          concept is formed around stereotypes and misconceptions about
          transgender youth. Moreover, the ROGD theory lacks consistency and
          clear definitions, making it difficult to apply rigorous scientific
          standards (Turban, Beckwith, Reisner, & Keuroghlian, 2019). In fact,
          it was widely criticized for lacking scientific rigor and for failing
          to meet basic standards of ethical research. It is important to
          emphasize that the majority of transgender individuals do not fit the
          ROGD narrative, the majority of them (including adolescents), have
          experienced their gender dysphoria from an early age. Gender dysphoria
          is a congential, lifelong, neurobiological condition, it is not
          something that can be attributed to social influences or peer
          pressure, this theory incorrectly conflates these two distinct
          concepts. The ROGD theory has been criticized for its reliance on
          assumptions rather than empirical evidence. As a result, it is not
          taken seriously by many experts and researchers in the field. It is
          essential to rely on scientific research and evidence-based approaches
          when discussing and understanding gender dysphoria and transgender
          experiences. As demonstrated, the ROGD theory lacks scientific rigor
          and scientists and experts in the field generally do not consider ROGD
          as a valid or scientifically rigorous theory. And more than 60
          psychology organizations, including the American Psychological
          Association, called for elimination of the term. Also, as of March
          2024, the article behind that theory was retracted.

          According to DSM-5-TR, the prevalence of gender dysphoria is 0.005% to
          0.014% of people assigned male at birth (5-14 per 100k) and 0.002% to
          0.003% of people assigned female at birth (2-3 per 100k). This rate is
          about the same globally. In Iran it's (1.46 per 100,000) [Talaei, et
          al. 2022], in Taiwan it's (7.4 per 100,000) [Kuo-Yu Chao, et al.
          2023], in Sweden it's (8 per 100,000) [Åhs, et al. 2018]. in the US
          it's
          <a
            href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5227946/"
            target="_blank"
            >390:100,000</a
          >. The prevalence can be influenced by societal acceptance, evolving
          diagnostic criteria, and healthcare access. Rates may vary based on
          the methodology and criteria used in studies, and their limitations.
          The occurrence of gender dysphoria is influenced by specific
          biological processes that are not widespread in the population, so
          it's impossible that being transgender is a trend. While social
          acceptance and awareness have increased, the percentage of transgender
          individuals in the population has remained relatively stable over
          time. This historical stability implies that it is unlikely to
          drastically increase in the future, however, just as the acceptance of
          left-handedness increased over the years, the growing social
          acceptance of diverse gender identities may lead to a higher reported
          prevalence (but not an actual increase in the number of transgender
          individuals, rather, a shift in the willingness of individuals to
          disclose their gender identity) and would then reach a stable level.
          It's essential to distinguish between visibility and societal
          acceptance on one hand and the actual prevalence of transgender
          individuals on the other.

            Gender dysphoria isn't diagnosed with brain scans because brain
            differences are too complex, and scans aren't advanced enough for
            diagnosis. Scans are primarily research tools and not yet precise
            enough for clinical use. However, recent machine learning models
            used in research can tell apart trans and cis people at rates much
            higher than chance. Still, for the time being, the medical standard
            is to diagnose based on the psychological symptoms of gender
            dysphoria (it's a neurobiological [meaning biological underpinnings]
            condition but has a psychological manifestation which is different
            from its etiology, i.e origins).

          As for the proportion of transgender women to transgender men. There
          are no reliable numbers due to: (1) attrition rates among trans men
          (attrition is where one starts transitioning and stops due to a lack
          of access to gender-affirming healthcare, stigma and prejucide,
          internalized transphobia and lack of support), (2) the visibility of
          trans women, (3) reporting bias and misidentification of trans men as
          cis men, (4) the existence of non-binary and genderqueer identities
          that easily captured in traditional data collection methods, (5)
          access to healthcare where trans women have more access, (6) social
          stigma and discrimination which prevents trans people from being open
          about their identities, or causes them to be undercounted or
          misidentified. Despite the lack of data and its aforementioned causes,
          studies have shown that although trans women were estimated to be
          higher in proportion than they actually are due to the factors
          mentioned above, we have seen a steady increase in the number of trans
          men such that the incidence now equals that of trans women due to the
          increased acceptance and destigmitization of the transgender community

          On the theory of Autogynephilia -the idea that some trans women are
          motivated by an erotic target location error-; There is no credible
          evidence to support this theory or Blanchard‘s other claims. Many
          studies fail to replicate Blanchard's findings or support his rigid
          classification system. Research attempting to validate his theory has
          often been criticized for small sample sizes, biased methodologies,
          and a lack of replicability. Researchers have found that the empirical
          evidence for Blanchard’s theory is weak. The concept is formed about
          stereotypes and misconceptions of trans people. Blanchard‘s
          definitions were inconsistent (Moser 2010) making it difficult to test
          the theory in a scientifically robust manner. He's been criticized for
          using biased samples and his flawed measurement tools also failed
          basic standards for psychometric instruments (Nuttbrock et al., 2011).
          Veale, Clarke, and Lomax have critiqued this theory extensively, and
          Moser's ‘autogynephilia in women‘
          <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19591032/" target="_blank"
            >(where 93% of cis women would be classed as 'autogynephilic')</a
          >. It should be also noted that the majority of trans women do not
          fall into either category of this theory, and that Blanchard‘s
          reaction to this is calling the trans women liars, in his eyes, the
          theory is unfalsifiable. A valid scientific theory must be
          falsifiable, meaning it can be proven wrong when presented with
          contrary evidence. Blanchard’s refusal to adjust his theory in light
          of contradictory findings violates this core principle of scientific
          inquiry. I also remind you that gender identity is distinct from
          sexual orientation.

            >Modern research clearly shows that gender identity and sexual
            orientation are distinct phenomena.</a
          >. The growing body of evidence on the neurobiology of gender
          dysphoria contradicts Blanchard's purely psychological or sexual
          explanation. As demonstrated, this theory is scientifically unfounded
          and has been largely rejected and discredited by the scientific
          community. Not to mention that paraphilia is excluded from gender
          incongruence in the ICD-11 Chapter 17, HA60.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Blanchard's work suffers the same critical flaw that required Sigmund
          Freud's work to be thrown out and completely reexamined over time.
          Refusal to admit his theory is not all inclusive and all explaining.
          Refusal to include any ways to prove his theory right or wrong.. it
          just is right in his mind. He culls his data the same way that all
          science does now. Which has made the recreation crisis we now suffer.
          Inherently, no matter how convincing or how much of a point it has, it
          must be utterly shunned till he agrees to fix it. It must be held to
          the standards of reproducibility, falsifiability, and integrity that
          define robust science.

        <!-- <p>Blanchard refuses to even acknowledge any data that disagrees with him.. even when it comes from his own
        studies. He's a man who saw two kinds of people and now insist that is all people. That's the level of

          Blanchard refuses to even acknowledge any data that disagrees with
          him.. even when it comes from his own studies. He's a man who saw two
          kinds of people and now insist that is all people. That's the level of
          professionalism he's operating on. There's a square hole and a round
          hole. Where does the oval piece go? That's right, we throw the oval
          piece away and pretend it was never there. What oval hole? No I didn't
          tape over that. You're lying to me. That's not tape over a hole. Stop
          lying. To him all trans women are either autogynephilic or homosexual
          men and he doesn't care about anything else but that preconcieved
          notion no matter how much data is against it. That there is some sand
          sized grain of truth in his typings makes them all the more dangerous
          as such. And frankly a lot of what he includes in it is also vague
          enough that you get the kind of.. internet personality quiz effect.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Logically those probably exist and it wouldn't be hard to drum up a
          couple, study them, and stamp a sheaf of papers and call it a hot new
          psychology. But it's telling Blanchard refuses to admit other data in
          if it happens to disagree. He.. 'curates' his data. Even if he
          collects it. He just says you are lying if it disagrees with his
          typings. then crosses you off. Notably this is how Sigmund Freud
          operated and he basically invented modern psychology so.. yeah par for
          the course. "What? No no everyone wants to fuck their mother. You're
          just lying to me."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Or his catch 22 of circular logic. He insisted everyone was repressing
          trauma deeply. Too deep to remember. If you disagree, you're just
          lying. And he knows cause you're just repressing it so hard you don't
          remember it. It's an unassailable argument cause it's self proving.
          And Freud in his day absolutely had the same cultists that follow
          modern psychology around.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Culled data? Circular arguments? Experiments that have literally no
          failure state or even refusal to experiment? A "I am just right"
          attitude? That's Freud.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The only reason Blanchard's work isn't ridculed to the ends of the
          earth is because no one genuinely thinks trans women are women
          mentally. The base assumption of the field is that it's mentally ill
          men and the form of the theories only reflect that. But frankly there
          has never been a single experiment that bares this fact out. There's
          always, always, a core group of dysphorics that they can't pry out of
          it. Once you cut away the abuse victims and people who are confused
          (or even certain bipolars) you are left with trans people. If it were
          just some kind of mental illness or mistake, they'd probably have
          found something to do about it by now under that notion. Nothing ever
          works. And ironically their best champion to proving gender is not
          real proved gender is inherent, and not spoofable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          John Money's experiments were inhumane but he succesfully proved the
          opposite of what he hoped despite trying to manipulate the situation.
          You cannot even raise cis people from newborns to accept a different
          sex as their own. It does not work. He literally just proved the
          existence of gender dysphoria and the concept that you can't socialize
          a brain to accept itself as the incorrect gender, but John Money was
          trying to prove you could train anyone to be any gender, but he proved
          the opposite. And this is even through doing things like abusing the
          kids outright. Sex is absolutely part of the brain inherently. From
          there it's trivial to ask.. what if someone's brain is wired the other
          way around? If this is true, you'd not be able to simply train them
          out of it or convince them. Not even when raised that way from birth..
          which is the plight of trans people. Shock of shocks.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          Money's cisgender victims kill themselves at the same age a lot of
          trans people do. For the same reason, because being raised at the
          opposite sex is incredibly traumatic, inherently.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          This is nonsense. Blanchard is full of it from top to bottom. Hidden
          by the fact you literally can find male sexual deviants and he just
          culls the data of anyone who isn't. Calls them liars. X's out their
          data. He admits to it himself.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          Regardless, what you should ask is why Blanchard culls his data and
          calls people liars when they won't agree to his preconcieved typology.
          And has no standard for proving his ideas right or wrong. He just
          inists they are right.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Also, trans women have unfortunately been pushed into the porn
          industry heavily. It’s a business which has completely consumed
          peoples understanding of trans women, because it is the media that
          most cis people more predominantly see trans women in, so their
          understanding of us is shaped around lust to begin with. blanchards
          argument presupposes that MtFs always have a sex drive and their
          actions are determined by this, but a lot of other trans women i know
          have said HRT briefly killed their sex drive to the point where they
          thought they were asexual, wouldnt they be cease being trans if the
          source is cut off? But no these women continued to become women, even
          in a state where sexuality seemed impossible.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That aside, one of the hideously glaring flaws in his idea is the
          simple fact that this makes all women inherently autogynophilic under
          his standards. All women. All natural women. Women like to feel like
          they are sexy and find feeling sexy sexy. This is not a hard train of
          thought to follow. Sexism, the thought line women have no sex drive,
          can't understand sex, and do not get horny. Ever. It leads to things
          like this. It is absolutely not strange that the joy and empowerment
          of feeling sexy would turn someone on. This shouldn't be shocking to
          anyone. Cis people also have a certain attraction to their own bodies.
          Its similar to cis men who work out (and even take hormonal
          supplements) to attain a certain body type Would it be fair to call
          gym rats auto androphilics, even if having a masculine body is
          something important for their sex life?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The comical thing here is.. part of the issue with all this is
          probably how little science cares about women or examining them in any
          capacity. What is 'normal' for a woman biologically or mentally or
          emotionally has next to no data. Those later two effect us cause even
          if we were just mentally women top to bottom.. there's no comparison
          point. No one cares about women enough to study anything.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In conclusion, it contradicts the mainstream scientific/academic
          opinion that comes from empirical evidence and peer-reviewed research
          as opposed to blanchardianism that comes from selective anecdotal
          observations, untested assumptions, and outdated theories,
          observational/speculative psychology without the robust data needed to
          support them scientifically, rather than rigorous science (not unlike
          a lot of early psychology, honestly).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So to anyone who tries to fetishize trans identity: What's the point
          of denying empirical evidence and instead relying on your
          observational armchair psychology theories that can't be proven or
          falsified? <br /><br />
          It is a biological mosaic of prenatal hormones, genetics (sex hormone
          receptor genes, DNA methylation, steroidogenic enzymes and
          coactiviatos or even individual genes involved in the sex
          differentiation of the brain), epigenetics (differential expression of
          X-linked genes that escape X-inactivation and parental imprinting in
          sex chromosome genes), endocrine disruptors, immune response, and
          self-organization and brain formation in the womb that results in
          gender dysphoria (neuroanatomical variance). This developmental
          pathway can't be more distinct than that of sexual orientation or
          paraphilia. To talk specifically about paraphilia, it's associated
          with atypical activity in regions involved in sexual arousal, impulse
          control, and reward processing. Dopaminergic dysregulation may play a
          role in heightened or deviant sexual urges. Early conditioning
          experience also shapes deviant sexual urges. Elevated testosterone
          levels have been hypothesized to contribute to paraphilia as well.
          It's mostly associated with trauma, maladaptive coping mechanisms and
          attachment issues and it emerges during puberty or early adulthood.
          This couldn't be more fundamentally distinct and unrelated to gender
          dysphoria.

          Apart from the embarrassingly pathetic repeated freudian mistakes
          (culled data by specifically seeking male sexual deviants and accusing
          anyone who isnt of being a liar and then dismissing their data,
          circular either or arguments, experiments without a failure state, "i
          am just correct") in his work, or the ironic absolute lack of
          reproducibility of his work (just like 80% of psychology studies;
          google replication crisis). <br /><br />

          Now we know that gender identity is biological. And its indisputable
          that gender identity, homosexuality and paraphilia stem from distinct
          developmental pathways. <br /><br />

          For example: <br /><br />

          Gender incongruence = differences in brain regions involving
          elf-perception, body ownership, and gender processing (meaning the
          insula, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and BNST AND MANY OTHERS).
          <br /><br />

          Homosexuality = linked to differences in sexual attraction processing.
          involving the hypothalamus and amygdala.
          <br /><br />

          Paraphilia = associated with impulse control, reward circuitry and
          compulsive behaviors. <br /><br />
          Lumping these together ESPECIALLY IN 2025 is scientifically
          illiterate. <br /><br />

          And when you bring this up, these uninformed critics just say
          "hurrurhuh do gay people not also have atypical sexual biology? why do
          they not need to transition" <br /><br />

          As if they have to share the same neural differences, when has that
          ever been implied even. absolutely absurd how they genuinely believe
          any deviation from typical sex development must lead to the same
          outcome, as if thats a damn rule in biology. <br /><br />

          they key question you have to ask yourself is "what aspect of
          neurodevelopment is affected?". <br /><br />

          For trans people, it is regions involved in self-perception, body
          ownership, and the sense of being male or female. These differences
          result in a persistent, internal mismatch between the brain’s self-map
          and the body’s sex characteristics, leading to gender dysphoria.
          <br /><br />

          For gay people, it is regions like the hypothalamus, amygdala, and
          reward-processing circuits. There’s no intrinsic conflict between
          their body and their self-perception, only in who they’re attracted
          to. No incongruence. Whichs why they don’t experience gender dysphoria
          or feel the need to transition. <br /><br />

          Both groups have atypical sex differentiation, but the effects
          manifest in fundamentally different ways. Omg! Who could've guessed
          this! Except We've known this since the 1990s and yet you have figures
          like JD Vance and Joe Rogan talking about "autogynephilia" in front of
          millions of people that do not know better and who will go to the
          voting boths and elect politicians who want to fine me $20,000 for
          using a bathroom and dictate what goes on MY state id/drivers
          license<br /><br />

          They cry out "appeal to authority" when you prefer the words of an
          expert who actually has the ability to correctly understand and
          interpret this complex academic work, literally PhD level research,
          with multiple PhDs from 5 different departments from 3 different
          univerisities one time, and a random layperson tries to debunk it.
          It's honestly just anti-intellectualism. But they can't see the
          non-sequitur in their words.
          <br /><br />

          “Appeal to authority” is only a fallacy when the authority is
          irrelevant or unqualified. These are actual domain experts with PhDs,
          MDs, and years of peer-reviewed research under their belt. That’s
          called listening to the people who know what they’re talking about.
          <br /><br />

          The problem is that we have people who barely have a high school
          diploma thinking they are qualified enough to even comprehend let
          alone evaluate scientific research in such complex areas. Zero
          scientific literacy. and then we have people who have spent tens of
          years doing exactly just that, conducting research with their peers
          using the most sophisticated technologies and research methods. And
          they are dismissed. Why? "appeal to authority 😭 "<br /><br />

          This research is endlessly complex. But oh my god is the human ego
          anything but a malignant tumor. How do these people think they're
          qualified enough to even know what the research is discussing. We
          unfortunately live in a world where gut feeling > actual empirical
          research. They dont know how evidence looks like, its all
          misinformation, logical fallacies and outdated pseudoscience that's
          been debunked for decades, long before anyone here was born. Honestly,
          this is all propagated by these chinese algorithms. Mothers were
          right, it is the damn phone. Maybe you cant blame these people, its
          all they see on the internet. I dont know. But what I do know is that
          scientific policy should be informed by domain experts, not demagogues
          or influencers
          <br /><br />

          It's honestly crazy to me how anyone who circulates blanchard's
          theories (that he inherited from his mentor and he inherited from his
          mentor, I'm not even joking. it's like an ethnic mythology at this
          point, no different than the ethnic origin story that the Turks have
          where a man made love to a wolf and gave birth to the so called
          Turkish race) as if its some groundbreaking knowledge. Social media is
          a cancer.
          <br /><br />

          His theory is literally twisted folklore of sexology, it goes like
          this. <br /><br />

          Magnus Hirschfeld -> Havelock Ellis -> Freud, Robert Stoller, and John
          Money -> Kurt Freund -> Ray Blanchard Hirschfeld developed early but
          flawed sexology, ironically, still miles ahead of what followed. How
          it ties to the rest of the chain is via the sexual intermediaries.
          <br /><br />

          Ellis was obsessed with categorizing "sexual inversion" but had no
          real neurobiological insight, he coined "narcissistic sexuality" which
          is where Kurt Fruend's erotic target location error (ETLE) theory
          comes from which is the basis of blanchard's AGP. <br /><br />

          the psychoanalytic theories of Freud, Stoller, Money was basically
          pure speculation mixed with unscientific assumptions about gender &
          sexuality. theorized that sexuality and gender identity were shaped by
          early childhood experiences. John Money, in particular, was known for
          his controversial ideas about gender role socialization. <br /><br />

          Bit of a tangent but Money believed that gender was nurture and not
          nature, and he force-trans'd David Reimer and castrated him and forced
          him to live as a female and never informed him since his birth but he
          ended up knowing and he killed himself later and this is another proof
          that gender identity is inherent and cannot be manipulated.
          <br /><br />

          Kurt Freund (the european man blancharad studied under) developed the
          phalometric tests used to "measure" sexual deviance (with all the
          biases you'd expect) his research was influenced by the idea that
          sexual preferences could be conditioned, similar to how Pavlovian
          responses are learned. He conducted studies using penile
          plethysmography (measuring arousal response) to analyze sexual
          attraction and deviation. <br /><br />

          Ray Blanchard took all of the above, stripped away nuance, and
          forcefed it into his rigid, circular, unfalsifiable theory.
          <br /><br />

          Quite literally a hand-me-down from a century of bad science. And
          people act as if its some groundbreaking discovery😹 literally just
          rebranded collection of outdated, untested assumptions that every
          major medical organization has rejected. Every single major medical
          organization rejects it, but they tell themselves "it's ideological
          capture". They think they exposed a hidden "gender ideology"
          conspiracy when its just archaic sexology that were never backed by
          empirical science. <br /><br />

          I have honestly grown to love how the ideologues that follow him today
          act like they've cracked the hidden truth that gender ideology doesnt
          want them to know when theyre just parroting century-old errors. It is
          simply a century of recycled mistakes and the lineage is flawed
          assumptions, biases, with circular reasoning. <br /><br />

          The closest thing blanchard got to empirical evidence is that letter
          by James Cantor: "New MRI Studies Support the Blanchard Typology of
          Male-to-Female Transsexualism", he was referrencing emerging research
          in the early 2010s. The study itself wasn't controversial, it just
          looks at neuroanatomical differences in male-to-female transsexuals
          and how they could differ by sexual orientation. it just doesnt draw
          the clearcut lines that he tried to make between "homosexual" and
          "heterosexual" trans women in his typology.

          <br /><br />It is more about overlapping neurobiological structures
          rather than supporting any rigid, dichotomous framework of
          Blanchard's. Cantor was essentially saying blanchard was right about
          one assumption he made outside of his theory therefore his theory is
          correct. Confirmation bias at its finest. Guy made a baseless guess
          with zero empirical foundation at the time then some research later
          happened to coincidentally support one tiny part of that guess,
          therefore "MRI studies support the blanchard typology of
          male-to-female transsexualism" 😹 😹 😹. Classic cherry picking to
          support a theory built on shaky ground. it is faciniating how they
          latch onto anything that seems to match their preconcieved story.

          <br /><br />
          As far as we're concerned, blanchard's data is false until proven
          otherwise. Especially because it suggests a radical shift from
          evidence-based guidelines and what is established so far of the
          etiology, much like what the Cass review does for adolescent care,
          which dismissed hundreds of studies supporting gender-affirming care
          for youth. Especially because it has never been replicated by any
          third party researcher. In fact the opposite was found. Go on the
          journals he was published in, nobody entertains his work other than
          2-3 colleagues. More proof that it has no scientific merit. Meanwhile,
          neurobiological gender dysphoria research has had 5,498 authors on 585
          different jounrals in the 1991-2022 period.
          <br /><br />
          Skepticism is warranted because the data is scarce with too little
          parameters (2 questionnaires he borrowed from Kurt Freund) with
          leading and pathologizing questions (also borrowed from kurt freund's
          phallometry), and answer scores were skewed based on his own bias and
          view of what a gay man should be into. And it had no control groups.
          This is without getting into the fact that it contradicts
          neurobiological empirical evidence, it was never even biologically
          validated. That is even more reason to demand more data that has
          enough parameters and is from a verified open source.
          <br /><br />
          But honestly, since his work was before the Renaissance in gender
          dysphoria research with its collaboration global expertise of
          neurobiology, biochemistry, embryology, epidemology and more (brain
          imaging, genetic/epigenetic studies, large-scale longitudinal data).
          It seems more appropriate to leave it in the dust, pre-neuroscientific
          era psychology holds no weight here. Blanchardism is pure speculation
          with no hard data or biological validation behind it. And modern
          research has since moved on. The fact that it failed to get traction
          among the academic community and only became known after Bailey turned
          it into a book for the laymen tells you all you need to know.
          <br /><br />
          Fetish-based etiology couldn't be more separate from gender identity
          etiology (established by thousands of peer-reviewed, replicated
          studies). Fetishes also lack a confirmed biological etiology, unlike
          gender identity. They're psychological/social in origin and are
          malleable and not core to self-concept. Very unlike gender identity
          development or dysphoria etiology.

          <br /><br />

          Blanchard's theory isn't science. It's recycled folklore—twisted
          through generations of bad sexology masquerading as insight. It
          contradicts virtually everything we know about neurodevelopment.

          <br /><br />

          It's important to note that psychological theories, particularly those
          developed before the modern era of neuroscience, endocrinology and
          genetics, are not inherently scientific unless they are backed by
          empirical evidence. Otherwise it's speculative at best and not
          scientific. Much of psychoanalysis is based on cultural norms and
          personal interpretation rather than on measurable biology or rigorous
          data. The mind and body are not separate; they are inextricably
          linked, and any theory that doesn't account for the biological
          underpinnings of behaviors, identities, or mental state should not be
          taken seriously.

          <br /><br />
          A lot of people nowadays have their little armchair psychological
          theories about everything that doesn't concern them, and this is why
          you should be skeptical. Say no to amateur pop-psychology, it's a bad
          cake baked from Dunning-Kruger (overconfidence), confirmation bias
          (cherry-picking) and lack of scientific literacy (ignorance of
          biology). The mind is not a mystery, it's biology in motion.
          <br /><br />
          When someone acts as if they're an expert on gender dysphoria and
          transgender health, contradicting medical consensus and making their
          own theories, and then responds with "I've done my research" when
          challenged, What does that mean? It usually means going online and
          seeing other people's opinions on it. That's doing their research. But
          that's not what doing research is. If you really wanted to do
          research, you should read the

            >1,847 peer-reviewed papers
          </a>
          from 1991-2022 Which would require an expertise in genetics,
          endocrinology, biochemistry, statistics, biology, neuroscience,
          embryology, epidemiology, biostatistics, machine learning, chemistry
          and mathematics to even begin to comprehend it. And you'd also need to
          understand scientific methodology on top of domain expertise with its
          study design, accounting for confounding variables and statistics to
          interpret data. Which very few people have, especially online.
          <br /><br />
          Also, the way through which data is verified in academic research is
          replication. Without that, we do not have a method of determining
          whether or not the data is legitimate and not culled/tampered with and
          check other crucial details such as data collection methods, sourcing
          and filtering. Even through peer-review, experts don't get access to
          raw data, where it came from or how it was gathered. Only summarized
          data in the form of tables or graphs. Peer-review is mainly about
          checking for logical consistency, plausibility and whether the
          conclusions follow from the results. They have to trust that the
          researchers reported everything accurately and procured the data
          ethically. Unless the journal enforces open data, which is rare
          outside top-tier ones and even then it's a very recent shift.
          Peer-review is simply a quality check, while replication is the gold
          standard for verifying data and its interpretation. Without it,
          there's no way to make sure whether findings are genuine, tampered
          with or even based on flawed methods in the first place.
          <br /><br />
          Remember that research is unreliable with few data (low N) because it
          decreases the statistical power of the sample, meaning random chance
          or outliers can dominate findings. Small samples may not represent the
          broader population. And they increase the error margin and decrease
          confidence intervals or widens its range (like 30%-70%) significantly.
          The p-value, which measures the probability that results occurred by
          chance is also important. A p < 0.05 is traditionally considered
          “statistically significant”, beware of cherry-picking to get p < 0.05.
          Honestly, raw data must be shared when studies get pre-registered.
          Variable control is essential as well, it means accounting and
          controlling for factors that could skew results: confounding
          (influences), dependent (outcome) and independent (factor) variables.
          <br /><br />
          Differentiating between conjecture and empirically validated findings
          is crucial. Conjecture is when the hypothesis has no evidence, often
          relying on extrapolation and/or assumptions. While empirically
          validated is when the hypothesis is backed by rigorous, replicated
          data that uses direct measurements. The concept of holistic data is
          also important, holistic data collects all relevant parameters to
          capture the full complexity of a parameter, while narrow data focuses
          on a few variables which leads to flawed insight and false confidence.
          Again, replication is absolutely critical to confirm findings and
          data.
          <br /><br />
          Falsifiability is the line between science and pseudoscience, a
          hypothesis must be disprovable to be scientific. Scientific "truths"
          are temporary consensus, not dogma. Consensus is when most experts
          agree, a good way to measure consensus is to look at the amount of
          studies pointing to the same findings. Disclose conflicts of interest
          such as funding, diversify research teams. This avoids bias. Complex
          questions such as gender identity and pharmacokinetics require
          interdisciplinary collaboration. Also, you must know that high
          citation counts ≠ scientific validity, especially in contested fields
          like sexology. Citations reflect attention, not agreement. For
          example, Andrew Wakefield's debunked autism/MMR paper has thousands of
          citations, not because it's valid, but because it's infamous. His
          citations often reflect notoriety, not merit.
          <br /><br />
          And this, is how science works. The scientific method is a systematic
          process of observing phenomena, forming testable hypotheses,
          conducting experiments to gather empirical evidence, analyzing
          results, and refining or discarding theories through repetition, peer
          review, and open revision to align with evidence.
          <br /><br />
          Psst.. Blanchard's studies were never replicated succesfully. His work
          relies too much on outdated Freudian-esque frameworks (where desire is
          the root of identity), rather than empirical evidence. Replication,
          biological integration & plausability and falsifiability are
          foundational criteria of credible evidence-based research. Blanchard
          skipped steps 4–7 of the scientific method (no replication, ignored
          contradictory data, no interdisciplinary collaboration mistaking
          gender identity with paraphilia, did not update his models based on
          new data). He's also only positively cited by ideologically aligned
          researchers.

          <br /><br />
          It also contradicts paraphilia research. Paraphilias (if biologically
          influenced) are linked to dopaminergic dysfunction and impulse control
          circuits, not gender identity networks such as but not limited to: (1)
          BSTc (Sex-dimorphic structure) (2) Insula (self-perception) (3) SLF
          (Body-ownership) (4) cortical thickness. Additionally, there's no
          plausible pathway for prenatal hormones to simultaneously create a
          female-typical gender identity and a male-typical paraphilic arousal
          pattern.
          <br /><br />
          A quick reminder that gender identity is shaped by biological
          processes in utero (genetics, hormone exposure, brain sexual
          differentiation) long before sexual arousal develops. If gender
          identity is wired prenatally, it cannot be explained by post-pubertal
          sexual fantasies. And the majority of trans people (male or female)
          start experiencing dysphoria by the time they're 7 years old. Modern
          research shows gender identity arises from: (1) Genetics: Variants in
          sex hormone receptors (such as CYP17, AR, etc.). (2) Epigenetics:
          X-chromosome inactivation, parental imprinting. (3) Neuroanatomy:
          Differences in self-referential processing (insula) and body ownership
          (SLF). (4) Endocrinology: Prenatal androgen exposure and brain sexual
          differentiation.

          <br /><br />
          This is lightyears removed from Blanchard's erotic fixation model.
          Attempting to merge it with neurobiology is like claiming that the
          humoral theory of disease compliments germ theory. It's a post-hoc
          rationalization with no empirical basis. Sexual fixation doesn't cause
          neuroanatomical and neurochemical differences. Also, Gender dysphoria
          isn't a phobia (an irrational fear), it's distress from bodily
          incongruence. They don't fear the traits associated with their
          misassigned sex at birth, they feel they don't belong on their bodies.
          This matches phantom limb research, where the brain expects a
          different morphology. Phobias are treatable with exposure therapy;
          dysphoria isn't. It's a circular argument, self-referential logic
          proves nothing.
          <br /><br />
          Dopaminergic systems (reward, impulse control) are implicated in
          paraphilic behavior, but gender identity is rooted in body schema
          networks, interoception, and sex-differentiated brain structures.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Gender dysphoria is a biological mismatch where it is typically linked
          to reduced exposure to or sensitivity to androgens during critical
          periods of brain development with a strong and well documented genetic
          factor especially in hormone receptors and signaling (AR, ER, CYP17,
          CYP19), DNA methylation and neurodevelopmental(FOXP2 &
          NR3C4)/neurotransmitter-related genes or epigenetic modifications
          (RYR3, SRC1/2), steroidogenic enzymes or differential expression of X
          chromosome genes and parental implanting. The brain regions involved
          in gender dysphoria are the central nucleus of the bed stria
          terminalis or interstitial nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus,
          gray-matter volumes and cortical thickness, self body image networks,
          hypothalamus, hippocampus, caudate, corpus callosum, and serotonin
          transport, parietal, frontal, insular cortex, and its connections with
          thalamus and putamen, hypothalamus and ventral striatum. Paraphilias,
          on the other hand are linked to atypical or excessive androgen
          exposure may influence sexual arousal patterns and the
          neurodevelopment factor affects brain regions involved in sexual
          behavior and reward pathways, the core mechanism is a disruption or
          hyperactivation in sexual arousal pathways. There is no evidence for
          genetic influence on paraphilias and most research is very
          speculative. The medical understanding of gender dysphoria is
          literally fundamentally inapplicable and incompatible with paraphilia.

        <p>
          Most of the current hypotheses for this condition presume a sex
          atypical differentiation of the brain, due to genetic, and/or an early
          organizational effect of testosterone during the fetal development
          (Giedd et al. 1997; Green and Keverne 2000; van Goozen et al. 2002;
          Bentz et al. 2007; Swaab 2007). These hypotheses also presume that the
          perception of the own sex is linked to sexual differentiation of the
          brain and that in transsexuals this perception differs from the body
          phenotype. Such a discrepancy is believed to be possible because sex
          differentiation of the brain occurs later in development than sex
          differentiation of genitals (Swaab 2007). This scenario is supported
          by several postmortem studies showing that male to female (MtF-TR)
          transsexuals, like females, have a smaller volume, and number of
          neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) compared
          with male controls- differences, which seem not to be influenced by
          sex hormone levels in adulthood (Zhou et al. 1995; Kruijver et al.
          2000). Recently, Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab (2008) also found
          "feminized" size of INAH3 in MTF-TR (Berglund et al. 2008).
          Importantly, these differences appear to be independent of sex hormone
          levels in adulthood, reinforcing a prenatal origin. Neural Systems for
          Own-body Processing Align with Gender Identity Rather Than
          Birth-assigned Sex (Adnan Majid, et al. 2020). Such findings indicate
          that gender identity involves a complex neural network, rather than
          isolated brain structures.

            >A response to the data showing that 50% of 'trans inmates' are sex
            offenders:</b
          >
          <br /><br />

          First and foremost, it reflects trans inmates, a small, atypical
          subset of trans women, many of whom are likely misidentified or
          opportunistic cases. Most trans people lead law-abiding lives, and
          using prison data without distinguishing between genuine and
          post-arrest trans identities risks inflating perceived criminality
          unfairly.

          <br /><br />

          That doesn't imply that at all or in fact anything about the the
          likelihood of the general population to commit those crimes, instead
          just implying that trans felons are more likely to be incarcerated for
          sexual offenses than other violent crimes.

          <br /><br />

          Trans population estimates, especially the british census estimate,
          are too unreliable to match the figures with the number of its sex
          offenders and compare them with the general population and its sex
          offender estimates. Even if they were reliable, you still couldn't
          compare the data this way (applying the rate to population estimates)
          because the population size is too small to account for anomalies, 60
          trans women being sex offenders is also a small enough number that it
          could mean an anomaly.

          <br /><br />
          You cannot base broad conclusions on, it is is a small enough number
          that it doesn't provide enough data to make any reliable
          generalizations about trans women as a group. The broad comparison
          between the two rates leads to a number that simply means nothing
          (small samples are more likely to produce unreliable, skewed results),
          it has no correleation to anything in reality. It could simply be an
          outlier or random fluctuation that doesn't reflect the broader
          population. It could be due to random chance rather than a true
          pattern of behavior within the population. This data cannot be
          extrapolated to imply broader behavioral trends.

          <br /><br />

          Using the same logic, you could look at violent crime statistics for
          black women when compared to white women and also conduct the same
          broad comparison between the two rates, this is also the same logic
          behind the 13/50 racist statement. In all 3 cases, it is statistical
          anomalies in small populations & sentencing bias in minority groups at
          play.

          <br /><br />

          You can't cite a statistic as being significant when it falls well
          below the threshold of being such, 60 out of a population of 100s of
          thousands is not statistically significant. It's a dot in the ocean.
          In statistics, a result is considered statistically significant if it
          is unlikely to have occurred by chance, typically determined by a
          p-value (often 0.05 or lower) or other measures. This threshold
          indicates that the observed effect or correlation is likely real and
          not due to random variation. This number (60) is too small to draw
          definitive conclusions or establish a reliable rate of behavior and
          could easily be the result of random variation, anomalies, or specific
          circumstances that do not represent the whole. There is a much higher

          <br /><br />

          Also, trans women are way more judicially persecuted than cis women
          for the same crimes, we also know women have a lower rate of
          persecution for sexual offenses and tend to be let off for it or not
          tried at all, which is also a failing of the judicial system. There's
          an overpolicing of trans women and an underpolicing of cis women.
          Trans people are mischaracterised as sex offenders in general and are
          more likely to be tried as such. The fact that they are being
          overrepresented despite making up such a small amount of the
          population means that trans women are specifically targetted,
          especially as sex offense crimes are underpoliced with regards to the
          general population, not individual demographics.

          to around 200 per 100,000 women (based on the assumption that 50% of

          The data in question isn't even applicable to most inmates; the
          Ministry of Justice itself says these figures (125-129 trans women)
          are not yet a reliable reflection of the true numbers, for three main
          reasons: (1) they can't count inmates who haven't told prison staff
          they're transgender. (2) they don't count inmates with a gender
          recognition certificate (3) they only count prisoners who have already
          had a case conference, which is reserved for longer sentences,
          associated with serious crimes. Also, I believe it goes without saying
          that violent criminals serving no less than 15 years aren't
          representative of the trans population, prison population is not
          indicative of the general population.

        Most importantly, there is very good reason to believe that most of
        those inmates aren't genuinely trans because they only declared being
        trans after their crimes [<a
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240228133917/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/24/government-figures-70-per-cent-of-transgender-prisoners-are/"
          >Rhona Hotchkiss</a
        >
        to The Telegraph, 2023]. It's essential to separate genuine cases from
        opportunistic ones. Perhaps this isn't about self ID itself but more-so
        the timing, which leads me to think it isn't genuine, timing and prior
        consistency are key indicators of authenticity. <br /><br />
        Nonetheless, It's reasonable to require a prior diagnosis to prevent
        misuse since perceived criminality is significantly inflated by
        opportunistic male offenders, as it's literally any man saying he's a
        woman with no safeguarding, there had been no medical, legal or even
        social report of them being trans prior to conviction. This is not to
        say that it's impossible for a trans person to transition post
        incarceration, but it's definitely a very tiny minority, a highly
        unlikely situation that should not be generalized. Especially given the
        high rate of post-conviction claim of only self identifying as trans,
        there is no reason to give opportunistic male inmates this much
        credibility. Not to mention that the population of trans people is
        underestimated which also skews the data.

        <br /><br />
        These factors contribute to a skewed perception of criminality. There
        needs to be careful examination and contextualization of the data,
        especially with factors surrounding it mentioned above. Anecdotal claims
        should be approached critically, avoiding drawing definitive conclusions
        without solid data. It's basically the 13/50 argument all over again, an
        abuse of data to make a "point" about a group you don't like.
        <br /><br />The high rate of sex offenses among trans inmates is skewed
        by a non-representative incarcerated population, widespread
        post-incarceration self-identification (no verification), small sample
        sizes prone to anomalies, judicial bias against trans women and a lack
        of reporting on cisgender counterparts, underestimated trans population,
        and media sensationalism.

          In the ancient times, the Mesopotamian Gala priestesses (assigned male

          Phrygian goddess Cybele played a similar role. In ancient Egypt, in

          In early Islamic Arabia, both the prophet Muhammad and Omar Bin
          Al-Khattab had trans women in their homes (Al-Bukhari 5235/6445),
          what's notable is that the prophet did not harm them in any way
          whatsoever, he only exiled the trans woman (after many years) in the
          hadith because the prophet noticed she had been interested in women
          and he still allowed her back on Fridays or Saturdays to get food
          (16983 - Bayhaqi vol 8 pg 390 Kitab Al hudud - 4324 Bukhari - 2181
          Muslim), and there were other trans women (1337 - Nisaburi & Ibn Hajar
          Asqalani 9040). They were known as "mukhannathun" (Arabic for
          'feminine', originates from khuntha meaning hermaphrodite/intersex it
          was only associated with homosexuality in the medieval period) at the
          time, there was a clear distintion between them and homosexuals,
          narrated Ibn Abdul Bar: "A mukhannath is not a person in whom
          immorality (i.e. homosexuality) is particularly known, but rather the
          extreme innate feminization so that he resembles a woman in softness,
          speech, sight, tone, and reason (referring to general cognition)."
          (المغني 7/463 ، الشرح الكبير على متن المقنع 7/347-348). <br /><br />
          I would even go as far as to call them companions of the prophet since
          the consensus of Islamic scholars is that any Muslim who was in the
          prophet's company even for an hour is one of the Sahaba. (Al-Nawawi
          2533, Imam Ahmad in al buhuti vol 1 pg 16-17). <br /><br />

          to supplement what the body doesn't produce adequately. Some people
          have spasmodic dysphonia/PVFM/MDT/Tremor/Nodules and need to undergo
          voice therapy with a speech-language pathologist. There are conditions
          like androgen insensitivity (which is pretty analogous to gender
          dysphoria's aetiology for trans men, only in the brain due to
          insufficient feminization) or turner syndrome and PCOS. This is all
          part of natural human diversity, another facet of treating natural
          variations in how bodies and brains develop.

          Pre-operative trans women and cis men are phenotypically (a phenotype

          subthalamic nucleus, corpus callosum & temporal lobes. The differences
          are a result of genetic, endocrine and fetal exposure factors. Those
          differences were observed by using multiple neuroimaging techniques
          including but limited to fMRI, DTI, VBM, PET, sMRI and EEG. They were
          always women and vice versa for trans men. It is a deeply ingrained
          part of who they are. It is NOT merely a psychological or social
          phenomenon, or gender expression or behavior but is rooted in a
          person's biological makeup from an early stage of development, and
          transitioning is simply a process of aligning their body and
          presentation with that inherent truth. Some sex differences in the
          brain arise before gonadal hormones are significantly active,
          suggesting genetic and epigenetic contributions. Brain and gonadal
          differentiation, while related, can diverge due to independent
          biological processes.

          Some would interject with something along the lines of "depression
          also has brain differences, but it's still a mental illness". Well,
          the brain changes with depression are state-dependent. Changes arise
          due to external stress, trauma, or prolonged emotional strain. The
          structural changes are mostly consequential, not inherent. And they're
          routinely reversible with anti depressants and therapy. While with
          trans people it's trait-like: differences reflect a stable, intrinsic
          aspect of brain development. Differences are emerging from prenatal
          neurodevelopment. Structural differences are not reversed by
          transitioning and they aren't caused by post natal hormones. Sex
          differences are even

          Their bodies are also uniquely suited to respond well to estrogen,
          which distinguishes them biologically from cisgender men. Hormone
          sensitivity and receptor activity: High estrogen receptor activity,
          low testosterone sensitivity and high estrogen sensitivity at receptor
          sites, and greater expression of the estrogen receptors with a lower
          density of androgen receptors. The cells express estrogen receptors in
          ways that allow a strong response to estrogen. Enzymatic activity:
          aromatase (which converts testosterone to estrogen) being more active
          may enhance HRT's affects. Differences in genes regulating hormone
          receptors also enhance the response to estrogen. Genes may include
          variations that create a biological environment more aligned with
          feminization, even if they're genetically XY. Genetic variations also
          dictate how hormone receptors are expressed and how enzymes like
          aromatase function. Prenatal endocrine factors such as fetal exposure
          to hormones or other developmental signals can also permanently
          influence how receptors and enzymes behave later in life. Their body's
          genetic and epigenetic traits are uniquely tuned to respond well to
          estrogen. This responsiveness is rarely observed in cis men when they
          undergo medical feminization (e.g., for gynecomastia treatment they
          take tamoxifen). Estrogen makes cis men

          many is reprogramming physiological processes including the
          cardiovascular system, nervous system and the immune system, bone

          function, melatonin regulation, DNA methylation, DNA repair,
          neuroprotection and protein synthesis, even melanin and so much more.
          And for progesterone the list goes: cardiovascular health, circadian
          rythm, thermoregulation, bone health, mood regulation, cognition &
          memory, neuroprotection & brain health (additionally plays a crucial
          element in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis.),
          electrolyte balance, metabolism, spasm reduction, immune response,
          musculoskeletal system, pancreatic function, skin health and
          elasticity, serotonin receptors (which for example affects how you
          respond to nicotine), lobuloalveolar & ductal development, EGF-1
          levels, respiration and more. it's down to the most fundamental
          molecular and cellular levels), your primary and secondary sexual
          characteristics and alters gene expression (how DNA ends up working as
          estrogen receptors literally bind to DNA and therefore regulate
          transcription) and cellular behavior along with overall physiology,
          let alone surgeries and how they change physiological characteristics.
          As the body regenerates cells through continuous turnover, estrogen's
          effects on gene expression and protein synthesis result in the
          production of cells that increasingly reflect female biology. Hence
          why it's simply a process of aligning the body with the brain, or in
          other words, transitioning is the process that aligns the body's
          biology and chemistry closer to the brain's differentiation. Calling a
          trans woman a man is like calling a butterfly a catterpillar. Also,
          most sex differences are hormonal, not chromosomal. Muscle mass, bone
          density, hair growth, etc. are maintained by current hormones, not
          chromosomes. And the brain doesn't care about chromosomes, neurons
          express sex hormone receptors, not "X" or "Y" detectors. These are
          niche cases. For 99% of biology—metabolism, immune function,
          cardiovascular health, etc.—hormones rule. Chromosomes pretty much
          only matter for fertility and not all cis women are fertile so how
          would that exclude them from womanhood? insisting on "XY = male" is
          scientifically reductionist. It doesn't functionally matter if you're
          XY once estrogen is in control. Biology is about dynamic systems, not
          static genetics. A trans woman on HRT is biologically far closer to a
          cis woman than to a cis man in nearly every measurable way.

          TLDR; Some people are trans because of prenatal hormones, genetics,
          epigenetics, endocrine disruptors, immune response, and
          self-organization and brain formation in the womb. No one chooses it,
          no one can change it. It has nothing to do with morals, sexuality, or
          upbringing in origin, dysphoria is an incongruence of physiological
          sex differentiation.
